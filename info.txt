Registers:
Each register is 64 bits wide, the lower 32- 16- and 8-bit portions
are selectable by a pseudoregister name. Some registers have a certain
purpose.
- rsp: being used as the stack pointer
- rax: the return value from a function
Other registers are all-purpse but have a conventional use depeding on
whether caller-owned or callee owned. 
If binky calls winky, binky is the caller and winky is the callee.
The registers used for the first 6 arguments and return value ar callee
owned. The callee can freely use those registers, and overwrite values.
If rax holds a value that caller wants to retain, the caller must copy
the value before making a call. The callee-owned registers are ideal
for scratch.temprary use.
If the callee intends to use a caller-owned register, it must preserve
its value and restore it before exiting the call. The caller-owned 
registers are used for local state of the caller that needs to  be
preserved across further function calls.

ERRNO
The value of errno shall be defined only after a call to a function
for which it is explicitly stated to be set and until it is changed
by the next function call or if the application assigns it a value.
The value of errno should only be examined when it is indicated to be
valid by a function's return value. Applications shall obtain the
definition of errno by the inclusion of <errno.h>. No function in 
shall set errno to 0. The setting of errno after a successful call to
a function is unspecified unless the description of that function 
specifies that errno shall not be modified.
